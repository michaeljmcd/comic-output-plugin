# Comic Output Plugin

This is an incredibly simple Calibre plugin to extract images from an ebook and
repackage them as CBZ files. Note that files are simply taken from the originating ebook, so 
pure text content is not converted. This is mostly useful for vendors who use an EPUB or MOBI
format as a container for comic book images.
